# WalkingTheDogiOS

Walking The Dog is a simple and fun way to make sure you are getting your dog enough exercise. You simply make a profile for your dog 
and specify how many walks, how many minutes and how many miles you want to take your fuzzy friend out for each day. If two users want to 
share a dog you can do that too. One user creates the dog and hits the "Generate Shareable ID" button in the Edit Dog screen. The button's
text will be replaced by your dogs unique 6 character shareable ID. When the second (or third or fourth user) wants to add the dog they 
simply use the shareable ID to import the dog and hit the Update button to save the pup. Now whenever the dog is taken out all users will 
see the update to the dog's stats in real time!

Once you have your dog set up you just hit the paw button on the bottom right of the homepage to start your walk. It will automatically time
your walk and calculate how far you went. When you are done you hit the "End Walk" button and watch your dog's stats grow! From the home screen
you can see how far you and your little buddy have traveled. If you want to look at big milestones you can look at the Achievements page 
from the menu.

If you have any questions please post them as issues here. Now go get walking!
